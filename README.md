# The Truth Is Out There - UFO Sightings

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive website using JavaScript & HTML to allow users to research and filter various UFO sightings around the United States. 

The website is quite user-friendly. As with most filter and search functions today, we created a clean and easy-to-navigate homepage allowing its user to filter data by data, city, state, country and shape of sighting. The results can also be filtered by using just one of the filter criteria.

Because the database attached to this website is so large and ever-changing, there is opportunity to make the site more interactive. One recommendation I have is to create a function that would allow the site to be updated simultaneously as the database is updated. As well, we could add additional pages to the site for user forums - creating more engagement and further exploration of unknowns foregin objects lurking about. 

Thank you!
